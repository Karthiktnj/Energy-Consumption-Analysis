# Energy-Consumption-Analysis
The Energy Consumption Analysis project focuses on assessing the energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions of Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations. The objective is to identify trends, evaluate conservation effectiveness, and suggest data-driven strategies for achieving climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.
Technologies Used:
Python for data cleansing and preparation
Power BI for exploratory data analysis and visualization
Tableau for interactive dashboards
GitHub for version control and code repository
Data Understanding:
The dataset spans from 2012 to 2021 and includes information about BPS organizations, such as public hospitals and school boards. Key attributes cover organization details, operational information, energy consumption, and GHG emissions.

Data Preparation and Cleansing:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Standardize units for energy consumption and GHG emissions.
Derive relevant features.
Segment the data by sector, organization type, and facility size.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Power BI:
Employ statistical analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.
Investigate correlations between energy consumption, GHG emissions, and relevant features.
Identify outliers and areas for further investigation.
Create compelling and interactive visualizations using Power BI.
Develop dashboards showcasing energy consumption and GHG emissions by sector, organization, and facility type.
GitHub Repository:
Maintain a public GitHub repository with a modular and functional code structure.

PowerPoint Presentation:
Create a presentation covering the following:

Problem Statement: Clearly define the problem and its significance.
Tools Used: Discuss the technologies and tools utilized in the project.
Approaches: Outline the steps taken for data cleansing, preparation, and EDA.
EDA Insights: Showcase key insights obtained from the exploratory data analysis.
Conclusion/Suggestions: Summarize findings and provide recommendations for future actions.
Evaluation Metrics:
Project evaluation will be conducted in a live session.
Demonstrate the modular code structure and adherence to coding standards (PEP 8).
Ensure code maintainability and portability across different environments.
GitHub repository must be public for transparency and accessibility.
